# ElectroMark

This project is benchmark maded by C/C++ and using GLSL for shaders, and for execution using Shell.
The benchmark got a integrated FPS / FrameTime meter.
If you want to run it : first clone the whole source code : git clone https::/github.com/AyoubCoding21/ElectroMark then you run cd ElectroMark && chmod u+x ./install_exec.sh && ./install_exec.sh to execute the program.
The shell file will first install the needed packages then compile and execute the benchmark.
Note : It is working on Linux only (Debian-based distros) so if you're in RedHat or OpenSuse or Fedora/Arch, you go to install_exec.sh and you replace apt with your package manager (dnf/zypper/yum...)
